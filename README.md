#OBS for Google Meet screen sharing

Utility to improve performe when sharing OBS in Google Meet.

GSuite does not support high FPS screen sharing, only shares screen or windows in a high resolution / low FPS way. But the sharing performance for Google Chrome Tabs its highly better, with a good FPS performance. This repository contains a web site to create a Chrome Tab that renders a camera in the window, which can be shared as a Chrome Tab from Google Meet. It fits with OBS or similar applications which support virtual camera generation.

To use the application just clone the repository and open the index.html webpage, which will launch a window with the camera shared. You can also use https://angelfernandezsobrino.github.io/google-meet-stream/
